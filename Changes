Revision history for Perinci

0.06     2012-03-01

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         + Access: Add _normalize_uri()

         + package: Set 'pkg_version' property value from $VERSION

         [FIXES]

         + Don't wrap non-functions


0.05     2012-02-23

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         + InProcess: Under load=1 (the default), even when loading module
           failed, continue anyway to access the package. This makes it
           unnecessary in most cases to create a custom object with load=0.


0.04     2012-02-23

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         + Access: "URI" in the form of X::Y is now assumed to be a Perl package
           name instead of qualified function name (dwimminess).


0.03     2012-02-23

         [BUG FIXES]

         + Metadata from wrapper was not used, so schemas in metadata not
           normalized.
